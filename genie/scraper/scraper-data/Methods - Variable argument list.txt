Java SE 5.0 added syntactic support for methods with variable argument list, which simplifies the typesafe usage of methods requiring a variable number of arguments. Less formally, these parameters are called varargs[1]. The last parameter can be followed with ..., and Java will box all the arguments into an array. Vararg parameter must always be the last method parameter:When calling the method, a programmer can simply separate the points by commas, without having to explicitly create an array of Point objects. Within the method, the points can be referenced as points[0], points[1], etc. If no points are passed, the array has a length of zero. To require the programmer to use a minimum number of parameters, those parameters can be specified before the variable argument:
