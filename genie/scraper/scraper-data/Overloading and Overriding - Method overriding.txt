To easily remember what can be done in method overriding, keep in mind that all you can do on an object of a class outside this class, you can do it also on an object of a subclass, only the behavior can change. A subclass should be covariant.Although a method signature has to be unique inside a class, the same method signature can be defined in different classes. If we define a method that exists in the super class then we override the super class method. It is called method overriding. This is different from method overloading. Method overloading happens with methods with the same name different signature. Method overriding happens with same name, same signature between inherited classes.The return type can cause the same problem we saw above. When we override a super class method the return type also must be the same. If that is not the same, the compiler will give you an error.Beware! If a class declares two public methods with the same name, and a subclass overrides one of them, the subclass still inherits the other method. In this respect, the Java programming language differs from C++.Method overriding is related dynamic linking, or runtime binding. In order for the Method Overriding to work, the method call that is going to be called can not be determined at compilation time. It will be decided at runtime, and will be looked up in a table.In the code section 4.31, the expression at line 3 is true if it is executed a morning and false if it is executed an afternoon. Thus, the instance of obj will be a MyClass or a SubOfMyClass depending on the execution time. So it is impossible to determine the method address at compile time. Because the obj reference can point to object and all its sub object, and that will be known only at runtime, a table is kept with all the possible method addresses to be called. Do not confuse:The implementation of this method is searched using the instantiated type of the called object (obj) and the declared type of the parameter object (myParameter).Also another rule is that when you do an override, the visibility of the new method that overrides the super class method can not be reduced. The visibility can be increased, however. So if the super class method visibility is public, the override method can not be package, or private. An override method must throw the same exceptions as the super class, or their subexceptions.super references to the parent class (i.e. super.someMethod()). It can be used in a subclass to access inherited methods that the subclass has overridden or inherited fields that the subclass has hidden.
